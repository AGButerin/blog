I conducted research on the topic: "should we create separate clinics for the elderly with different kinds of benefits?" by polling people on the street I found out that 83% of respondents were in favor of dividing the clinics into adult/elderly. People under 30 voted unanimously for dividing the clinics because it is very difficult to get an appointment with a doctor due to the huge number of elderly people.
