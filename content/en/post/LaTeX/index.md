**Introduction**

text, applying formatting, and incorporating complex elements such as tables, formulas, and graphics. One of the most powerful and widely used markup languages is LaTeX. This report is dedicated to the basics of LaTeX, its key features, and its applications.

1. Basics of Markup Languages

Markup languages are used to describe the structure and format of text. They include tags and commands that specify how the text should be presented. The main goals of markup languages are:

• Structuring: Defining the structure of a document, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

• Formatting: Applying various styles and formats to the text, such as bold, italic, and color.

• Inserting Complex Elements: Adding tables, charts, formulas, and other special elements.

2. What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a text preparation system based on the TeX markup language, developed by Donald Knuth. LaTeX provides a high-level interface for working with TeX, simplifying the creation of complex documents and managing their formatting.

3. Basic Principles of LaTeX

• Declarative Approach: In LaTeX, users describe how they want the document to look, and the system takes care of applying the necessary formatting.

• Commands and Environments: LaTeX uses commands starting with a backslash (\) and environments, denoted by the \begin and \end commands, to create various document elements.

• Document Structuring: LaTeX documents have a clear structure, including a preamble, main content, and sections, which simplifies text organization and formatting.

4. Basic LaTeX Commands and Elements

• Preamble: Includes commands for setting up the document, such as \documentclass, \usepackage, and defines global parameters.

• Document Sections: Commands like \section, \subsection, and \subsubsection are used to create sections and subsections.

• Text Formatting: Commands like \textbf{}, \textit{}, and \underline{} apply bold, italic, and underlined styles to text, respectively.

• Lists: LaTeX supports both bulleted (itemize) and numbered lists (enumerate).

• Tables: Commands such as \begin{table} and \begin{tabular} are used to create tables with customizable structure and formatting.

• Formulas: LaTeX provides powerful tools for working with mathematical formulas through environments like equation, align, and others.

5. Examples of Using LaTeX

• Scientific Articles: LaTeX is widely used for preparing scientific papers and reports where accuracy and a professional appearance of formulas and references are crucial.

• Technical Documents: Creating technical documentation where complex formatting and the inclusion of tables and charts are required.

• Books and Theses: LaTeX is ideal for writing books and theses due to its ability to handle long texts and manage tables of contents and indices.

6. Tools and Resources for Working with LaTeX

• Text Editors: For working with LaTeX, text editors such as TeXShop, TeXworks, Overleaf, and others can be used.

• Packages and Classes: LaTeX supports various packages and classes that extend its functionality, such as amsmath for mathematics or geometry for page layout.

• Documentation and Communities: Official LaTeX documentation and communities like Stack Exchange provide resources and support for users.

7. Conclusion

LaTeX is a powerful tool for creating documents with complex formatting and structuring. Its declarative approach, support for mathematical formulas, and ability to handle various document elements make it indispensable for scientific and technical texts. Understanding the basics of LaTeX will help users create professionally formatted documents and manage their content effectively.
